Microsoft Stock Forecasting Using LSTMs
This project focuses on forecasting Microsoft (MSFT) stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) widely used for time series forecasting. The repository contains all the necessary files, including the dataset and implementation code, to train and evaluate the LSTM model.

Introduction
Accurate stock price forecasting is a critical challenge in financial markets. This project leverages LSTMs, which are effective in capturing temporal dependencies, to predict Microsoft stock prices using historical data.

Dataset
The dataset, MSFT.csv, contains historical stock price data for Microsoft. The key columns include:

Date: The trading date.
Open: Opening stock price.
High: Highest stock price of the day.
Low: Lowest stock price of the day.
Close: Closing stock price.
Volume: Number of shares traded.
Dependencies
To run this project, ensure the following libraries are installed:

Python (3.7 or higher)
NumPy
Pandas
TensorFlow/Keras
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Install the dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/Microsoft-Stock-Forecasting-LSTMs.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Microsoft-Stock-Forecasting-LSTMs
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "Forecasting Microsoft Stock Prices Using LSTMs.ipynb"
Run the cells in the notebook to:
Preprocess the data.
Build and train the LSTM model.
Visualize the predictions.
Results
The trained LSTM model forecasts the stock prices with reasonable accuracy. The final notebook contains visualizations comparing actual and predicted stock prices.

Sample Output:

Blue line: Actual stock prices
Orange line: Predicted stock prices
Future Work
Improve the model by tuning hyperparameters.
Incorporate additional financial indicators.
Experiment with different deep learning architectures (e.g., GRUs, Transformers).
